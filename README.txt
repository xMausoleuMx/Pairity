Project Start: 2017/7/31
Author: John Williams

	The goal of this app is to be able to sync folders between your phone and computer over the internet. Any actions done in synced folders will be mirrored. For example if you
delete a file from your phone, it will also delete the file from the synced folder on your computer. It will also transfer files and edits to the corresponding location.
	
	The inspiration for this project comes from me having an ever changing offline music collection that I hate having to edit twice across my devices.

	Hopefully will be able to connect the phone directly to the computer without using a server as a middleman(other than to initially point the phone in the right direction)
pehaps I will make a paid service that will hold onto edits and commands if either the phone or computer is not on or recieving at the time of edits.
